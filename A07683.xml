            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of which there ſhould neede no other euidence, then mine owne conſcience to condemne me, if conſidering the world as it is, and perceauing how many, many wayes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, I ſhould ſitte ſtill and be idle.

<note place="margin">Guido.

So I, beholding in this buſie age of the world, ſome imployed in the warres abroade, an honourable and now moſt needfull ſeruice, others in gouernment at home no leſſe neceſſary, then of neceſſitie to be maintayned, haue buſied my ſelfe in turning my bookes too and fro: which being in him a ſtranger, in a ſtrange common wealth commended, I hope in me in mine owne Countrey ſhall not be reprooued, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that proceeding further, I haue deliuered faithfullie, what of thoſe faithfull friends which neuer flatter I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, tending to the good of the common good, as I conceaue.

Of default where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though there were no ſpeciall cauſe, ſpecially to ſuſpect any, yet what is done to that ende, ought not to ſeeme vaine, partly, for that much is aboue all poſſibility of ſatisfaction due, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
<pb facs="tcp:13177:3"/>becauſe euen the beſt to good things are often ſlow. For (to ſay truly) while men are, they are but men, who being clothed with ſinfull fleſh, cannot be ſo cleanſed from ſinne, which liueth and dyeth with the fleſh, but that ſome corruption thereof of neceſſitie will remaine, which will in all fortunes miniſter iuſt cauſe of blame. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that being afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any ſort, we murmure, complaine, and lament, and in the greateſt happines we can haue, ſildome are we thankfull, or well content ſo far forth as we ought to be. The conſideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath moued many, whether feeling in them ſelues, or finding in others of faults ſo great, too great a miſchiefe, highly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend valiancie as the chiefe vertue, aboue all to condemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude as the worſt vice, and conſtancie in what eſtate of life ſoeuer, as moſt auailing, and beſt beſeeming to aduiſe.

It was well with Rome when vertue with her was ſo embraced and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13177:9"/>ſo rewarded. But when waxing proud, ſhe waſted her wealth, in ſumptuous buildings, ſuperfluous feaſts, and rich attire, wantonnes was in her ſtreets, vice poſſeſſed her houſes, and miſerie ſoone after ouertooke her ſelfe. Be thou therefore at deſiance with pride, forbeare all vanitie and ſuperfluitie of expence. Know that houſes are places to bayte in for a while, and not to abide in for euer, that they are prouided to ſerue neceſsitie, rather then to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh delicacie, and that for the common wealth much better it is that good hoſpitality be kept, then that faire houſes be built. Remember alſo that men ſhould eate to liue, not liue to eate, and that the throat being giuen but for a paſſage to the ſtomack, from whence to euery part nouriture is to be ſent, for maintenance of the body, abſurd and vile it is, for the throats onely pleaſure, to burthen the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to weaken the body, to dull the minde, to empty the purſe, and to ſhorten the life; none gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by a carcaſſe pampered, but wormes by which it ſhall be deuoured. Laſtly thinke, how vaine the exceſſe of apparrell is, whereof the great varietie ſheweth the extreame vanity of the people: all coſt being loſt, which is beſtowed in the needleſſe bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thereof. It ſerueth to effeminate the minds of men, to prouoke the luſts of the fleſh, and to kindle pride in the hart, and cauſeth many to want in theyr olde age, which had too much in theyr youth; whoſe folly ſeemeth no leſſe then theirs, which lade them ſelues with many clothes in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13177:10"/>Sommer, and for want goe naked in the VVinter. Of all theſe the vſe is needefull, but hurtfull is the abuſe, which being diſcouered is to be reſtrained in a well ordered common wealth. O that thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would conſider this, and make profit thereof, in ſparing from their bellies to feede the hungry, in ſauing from their backes to cloath the naked: So ſhould they abſtaine from euill, and doo good, they ſhould auoide the offence, and procure the fauour of Almightie God, and much more able ſhould they be to ſerue thee for defence of them ſelues.

But this now is not, nor hath been many yeares thy caſe. Thou art ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by law, agreeable to iuſtice, and executed with mercy, thy Soueraigne ſubmitteth her ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that the greateſt may not diſdaine, and the meaneſt be willing, to obey her according to the ſame. Beſides, thou art inſtructed in the knowledge of God, that of conſcience thou ſhouldeſt perfome thy duty, both to him and her. If the weake be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in her grace they finde reliefe, if the ſtrong preſume too farre, her Maieſtie doth hold them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whereby it commeth to paſſe that eyther for conſcience ſake, or by force of gouernment, thou haſt peace and knoweſt no warre at home. And that thou mayeſt be ſtrong againſt foraine inuaſion, thou art furniſhed with armes, and trayned to vſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13177:12"/>them, many braue men haſt thou practiſing the warres abroade, ready to returne when thou ſhalt neede them for thy ſuccour, and ſo faſt knit are the parts of thy body, the lower with the higher, all with the head, that thy ſtrength is redoubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee.

Although thou doeſt not ſhine with vertue without all ſtaine of vice, though thou breedeſt and feedeſt weedes with thy Corne, ſome wicked amongſt many good Children, yet if thy vice deface not thy vertue, if the weedes ouer-grow not the Corne, and the wicked doo not ouercome the good, thou haſt no cauſe to ſuſpect thine ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. So long as a diſeaſe take not the head, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe not the hart, nor runne through the whole body, there is great hope of cure, no daunger of death.

And when the Lord fought for Iſraell againſt the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, he ſtayed the Sunne in Gibeon, &amp; the Moone in the valley of Aialon, vntill the people auenged them ſelues of their enemies. So as the Sunne abode in the middes of the heauen, and haſted not to goe downe, for a whole day, and there was no day like that before it, nor after it. In like ſort it is greatly to be hoped (which aboue all things with feruent prayer is to be deſired) that the ſame God will ſtop the ſtreame of whatſoeuer may hurt thy Soueraigns health, and ſtay the courſe of her life ſo long, that no health, no life, of any mortall Creature ſhall be like vnto hers, that ſhyning amongſt the Princes of the earth, as the Sunne amiddeſt the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſhe may giue light and life vnto his church for a long while, &amp; be very late, if not the laſt, in going downe. No doubt as it was the pleaſure of the omnipotent God to deliuer her out of the hands of her aduerſaries in miraculous ſort, and to rayſe her to her princely ſeate ouer thee, and as of eſpeciall and exceeding fauour, he hath in wonderfull wiſe euer ſithence preſerued her from the miſcheeuous practiſes, and dangerous attempts of many enemies abroade, and at home, firſt that ſhe might be, ſince for that ſhe hath been, a careful nurſe of his church, and tender mother of his children, and ſo hath bleſſed her with honour and riches, that her breaſts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13177:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>flow with milke, and her bones runne full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to the continuall feeding, and ſtrengthning of his Goſpell. So mayeſt thou be well aſſured, I ſpeake what I hartily wiſh, and am verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, that good God by whom ſhe now liueth and raigneth in Maieſtie, will ſhew his power to the worlds wonder, in the length of her dayes, and glory of her kingdome, if for the rebellion of thy people againſt him, he take not her to him ſelfe, as more worthy to raigne with Angels in heauen, then to dwell with ſinners, (wicked, and vnruly ſinners, in denying God, and diſobeying her) vpon earth. Beware therefore thou prouoke not the Lord thy God, by preſumptuous ſinnes to change his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to turne his face away from thee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that for the tranſgreſsion of the Land there are many Princes thereof. Let thy people feare God, ſo ſhall they not feare the loſſe of her vnder whom, by his goodnes, infinit bleſsings they enioy, and thou art famous aboue all Nations. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem is fallen, and Iudah is fallen downe ſayeth the Prophet, and why? becauſe their tongue and works are againſt the Lord to prouoke the eyes of his glory. That which was ſayed concerning Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and Iudah, thinke to concerne thee, and know, that if thou committeſt the like fault, thou art like to feele the like ſmart, for he that ſpake it is one, and the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for euer.

For when God made the world, and all the creatures therein, he created man amongſt them the beſt, becauſe aboue all the reſt he would be honoured by him. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other being finiſhed, laſtly, his body was made, and his ſoule created, his body with eyes to behold, and his ſoule with reaſon to conſider, as well them as him ſelfe, VVhich together with him ſelfe being creatures, were all made as liuely witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God that Creatour, whom he eſpecially was bound to honour: But although the firſt man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in all perfection of body and of ſoule, was no ſooner a man, but he perceaued, and knew there was a God, ſo as to him that knowledge was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as his nature was perfect euen at the firſt, yet when through the fall and diſobedience of that firſt Father of mankind, the perfection of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was vtterly loſt, it could not be that they which after ſucceeded, not beeing made by the hand of perfection, but by the ſeede of corruption begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and engendered, eyther ſo ſoone or ſo well, ſhould attayne there-vnto: nay, rather, conſidering
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13177:17"/>the great tranſgreſsion of that offender, in being not onely vnthankfull to ſo bountifull a God, as had giuen all things for his vſe, but rebellious to ſo mightie a Lord, as had power ouer heauen and earth, worthily all weakenes was to haue followed, and the darke miſt of ignorance, for euer to haue blinded the eyes of his poſterity. But God hauing an eternall purpoſe both of iuſtice and mercy, was pleaſed to leaue reaſon the naturall eye of the ſoule vnto all, by courſe of time to obtayne a meaſure of perfection, whereby to know there is a God, and to his moreouer to giue fayth, a ſupernaturall and more excellent eye of the minde, whereby to beleeue in God, and to liue for euer. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it was his will to ſet forth a double booke to the world, the one his works, the other his word, that in the one as many as were appoynted to be his, might learne to know him a right, to ſerue him after his will, and to repoſe their truſt in him for their endleſſe comfort; and in the other, all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer might ſo behold him, as they ſhould not chooſe but perceaue him to be a God, and haue no cauſe in excuſe of them ſelues, to ſay that he was hidden from them.

So as a godleſſe foole which hath no knowledge or ſence of God, being that earthly man which is duſt, fleſh, and corruption, beginning in vncleannes of ſeede, and ending in the foode of wormes, is truly ſayed to be a man, though in truth he is not halfe a man. For that he wanteth the inward, that is the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man, which being much the better part, is much to be eſteemed the greater halfe. And yet muſt it be confeſſed that in reſpect of that leſſer and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer halfe, hee doth beare the name of the whole. And for as much as that part doth onely appeare, and without that, the other can haue no being in the world, nor can exerciſe his power but by means thereof, therefore it commeth to paſſe, in regard of that ſecreſie and neere coniunction betweene them, that the open ſhew of the outward man, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all a like to be taken for men, becauſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort are apt to thinke the beſt of that which is doubtfull, and the worſer will not ſuſpect others, leaſt they ſhould condemne them ſelues.

But wherof then ſhould they be thought to be? The proportion remaineth, and the lyuing body of man: True, but the minde wanteth which is the breath of life, whereby not the body but the ſoule of Adam was ſayed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aliue; before which breathed into him, hee was a dead body, and without which breathing within vs, we are, though not dead bodies, becauſe our fleſh lyueth, yet dead in ſoule, for as much as the ſoule onely of a brute beaſt doth liue within vs; and ſo being, we are inwardly beaſts, and men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in outward appearance, and therefore to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather beaſts then men, for that it is the life and not the ſhape, the nature and not the picture, that cauſeth true things to be diſcerned from counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite, and truly giueth the denomination to euerie thing.

Happy were it for all Atheiſts if in like ſort God would lay his rod of correction vppon them, whereby at the length, though after many yeares, they might be brought to know both God, and them ſelues; that heere they might ſee the end of their miſeries, which heereafter will be endleſſe,

So as man hauing ſence and reaſon, cannot be ignorant or doubtfull thereof, when by ſence he may perceaue, and by reaſon conſider, what thoſe creatures are which ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet forth the being of their Creator. Opening his eyes toward heauen aboue, or to the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, he doth behold ſuch variety, ſuch excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of worke, ſo much beyond his skill to iudge of, ſo farre aboue his power to reach vnto, that not onely his minde is mooued to a ſodaine admiration of that he ſeeth, but his hart is touched with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne reuerence of that, whatſoeuer is Author thereof, though what it is he doth not conceaue. For reaſon,
<note place="margin">Reaſon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the knowledge of God.</note> his guide, by nature leadeth him to think that ſtrange and notable effects cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but from ſome rare or worthy cauſe, and that although the cauſe in the effects be reſembled, yet

VVherby it cometh to paſſe that looking onely vpon the frame of heauen, and face of the earth, &amp; beholding the great beauty of them both, th'one being adorned with ſtarres of ſundry formes and bignes, the other ſet with trees, and deckt with flowers, of diuers colours and proportions, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke that frame and that face, of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beauty, to haue beene made and deuiſed, by ſome skill of excellency, where-vnto of duty reuerence doth belong. VVhich are things ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and apparant, as by men of common reaſon they are ſeene and perceaued. But who ſo with a ſharpe eye doth enter into the world, and vvith ſound iudgement examine the parts thereof, he eaſily doth finde, that the whole, and euery parcell of the ſame, is like a glaſſe of Chriſtall, wherein the might and maieſtie of God doth ſhine in ſuch ſort, as that the eyes and minds of all, be they not ſtarke blind, and voide of vnderſtanding, are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and pierced therewith, ſo that they are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſee whom to acknowledge, and they cannot but acknowledge God, whom their eyes doo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to be the maker and ruler of heauen, and of earth, and of all things therein contayned.

But let vs examine a part, the ſundry parts, of the great and little world, whom God that Lord of all, vſeth as inſtruments, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth as officers, to execute his will, and to ſhew his power, and we ſhall ſee that with one voyce they witnes all, and all agree in one, that they had a maker, and haue a Maiſter, by whoſe power at the firſt they were, and at whoſe commaundement continually they are.

For it is ſeene that water is drawn vp neere the fire, which ought to remaine below the ayre, and ayre paſſeth downe into the earth, whoſe place is prefixed aboue the water, whereby their peace is broken, and they are at warre amongſt them ſelues, the ayre thundering aboue, and the earth trembling below. True that ſo it is, and fit it ſhould be ſo, the more to ſhew his aucthority that doth commaund, and their dutie which doo obey; for thereby appeareth his power in heauen and on earth, when he thundereth from heauen, and ſhaketh the earth, and that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are his inſtruments to vſe at his pleaſure, when he maketh them to followe and to forſake their nature. VVhich is done, the water aſcending, and the ayre paſsing downe, and after the ſame

The vpper part in which the hart is ſeated, may be compared to the higher heauen, the eight ſphere wherein the ſtarres are fixed, which holding one iuſt and continuall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giueth light and life to all the world beneath, through ſhining beames, and comfortable warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it ſendeth downe, and euery where beſtoweth: for ſo the hart being ſtill in motion, after a iuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion preſerueth the whole body, in life and health, by ſending forth the ſpirits of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is well ſtored into all the parts by vaines and arteries in due courſe to be conueighed.

<note place="margin">In man ſome thing reſembling euery cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.</note> it is to be thought that he was made to repreſent not any one, but all the creatuers of the world: which yet to make more manifeſt, ſome things hee hath of them all, whereby in him alone theyr counterfaite may ſeeme to be drawne,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13177:31"/>and layed open to be ſeene. His fleſh is as the earth, ſound, ſubſtantiall, and firme, it is braunched with ſondry vaines, as the earth is diſtinguiſhed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mettals. VVhich therefore are ſayed to lye in vaines, becauſe they follow the like courſe, and are diſperſed a like: inwardly with bone, as the earth with ſtone it is ſtrengthned, it is quickned and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, with the ſame life that cauſeth plants to ſpring and hearbs to grow, and like times it hath for the renuing and decay of blood, as they haue for the riſing and falling of their ſap.

And as in the outward faſhion and diſpoſition of his fleſh, ſo in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions and diſpoſitions growing from the ſame, he is to him ſelfe vnlike,

For what beaſt is iealous or malitious, what giuen to reuenge, or mooued with compaſsion, which doth hope or diſpaire, which counterfaite, or diſſemble? The Leopard is not ſo changeable in the ſpots of his skinne, as man is variable in the affections of his minde. Innumerable are his fancies, vnſpeakable his conceits, infinite his deuiſes and deſires. The daily new faſhions of attires, the ſondry formes of ſumptuous buildings, the rare inuentions of all kinds of arts, faculties, and miſteries, are euident proofes that the humours of mens minds are euer flowing, and like the riuer Nylus, <hi>Semper aliquid apportant noui.</hi> Bring euer forth ſome new thing or other.

All which are properties belonging to the nature of God, and not found in any naturall thing, but onely in the ſoule of man,
<note place="margin">God ſaid to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall man, and man a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God.</note> which from God was breathed into him. VVherefore, for the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance betweene them, the heauenly God hath beene ſayed to be an immortall man, and an earthly

<note place="margin">Caelius Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. ex Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eurio.</note> man being taken in reſpect of his diuine ſoule for a God on earth, and God eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in regard of that humaine image, to be a man in heauen. Such was the conceit of a mortall man, who perceauing that diuine part of him ſelfe, farre to excell, and greatly to differ from his earthly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could not but thinke that there was a deity of like quality,
<note place="margin">The being of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by the being of the ſoule ſo like vnto him.</note> that was Authour thereof. So is the being of God fully prooued, in being ſo truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by that, which ſuch a creature could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene, had it not by ſuch a Creator beene cauſed to be, as is a God ſpirituall and immortall, that euer was, and euer ſhall be. For impoſsible it were that a bodily ſubſtance ſhould beget a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſſence, and that from mortall ſeede an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſoule ſhould ſpring.

VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what could not be made by naturall meanes, whoſe bounds are certaine, muſt be thought to haue been created, by a power ſupernaturall whoſe limits are vnknowne; which being diſcouered in effects to be wonderfull, is to be deemed a cauſe admirable, in all heigth of reuerence rather to be eſteemed, then either to be denied, or doubted of. Sith then the image of God is lodged within the body of man, and continually doth preſent it ſelfe, to the view of reaſon, no leſſe then the face lyeth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13177:33"/>open of the eye to be ſeene; as impoſsible it may ſeeme that a man ſhould think that there is no God, whoſe picture within him ſelfe the eye of his mind doth ſtill behold, as it is incredible that ſeeing his owne face in a glaſſe, he ſhould not iudge it to be the face of him ſelfe. For more certaine is the ſight of reaſon being ſound, and leſſe ſubiect to deceite, then is the iudgement of the outward ſence, which ſondry wayes by outward meanes may be deluded. But if any be ſo blinded with the miſt of ignorance, that by looking into his owne nature, he cannot diſcerne that image of God, yet turning from him ſelfe, and caſting his eyes vpon the creatures of the world, if any thing he can thinke, he cannot but think, that there is a God. For what can be thought to mooue heauen, but that which made it? VVhat to open and ſhut the gates thereof, one whereat the Sunne goeth forth in the morning, the other wherin it returneth in the euening, but that which dwelleth therein, and hath rule ouer the ſame? VVhat to ſet in order ſuch an army of ſtarres, and to cauſe them all to hold one certaine &amp; iuſt courſe, but that to which all things are eaſie, and nothing is impoſsible? VVhat to reſtraine the fire from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and the earth from falling down, to keepe the Sea from ouer-flowing, and to ſet peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene fire and water, in diſcord to make vnitie, and a friendly coniunction between things of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie diſpoſition, but that power which hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer heauen and earth, and doth commaund

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He world conſiſting of heauen and earth, it may ſeeme to haue beene the pleaſure of God, the maker of them both, to place in eyther of them, one ſpeciall creature, that for excellencie and vnity of nature, ſhould be the picture &amp; image of him ſelfe. The ſunne in heauen, and on earth the ſoule of man; to the ende that man, of whom chiefely he would be honoured, beholding the ſunne with his bodily eye, and with reaſon the eye of his minde, looking into his owne nature, as well without, as within him ſelfe, might perceaue, that a God there is, and that there is but one: who doth both ſhine in heauen, as that glorious ſtarre the Sunne, and rule on earth, as that excellent creature the ſoule, where-vnto all other liuing creatures are ſubiect. Of this it hath been ſpoken,
<note place="margin">The Sunne a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God.</note> of that it may be ſayed, that being in the firmament aboue, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth his power on all the creatures below, and holding an vnitie in it ſelfe, it diſperſeth it ſelfe through the corners of the world, and giueth light to euery ſtarre that ſhineth, and cauſeth life in euery thing that liueth, and is of ſuch brightnes, that it darkneth the moſt glittering ſtarres, and dazeleth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13177:35"/>the ſharpeſt eyes, although neither ſtarre haue light, nor eye ſight, but by meanes thereof. So as verie notably it expreſſeth the nature, and the power of that onely and mighty God, who from aboue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, and ordereth all thinges whatſoeuer or whereſoeuer beeing, and giueth ſight and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to all, albeit in his greatnes and glory, of none he can be ſeene or vnderſtoode, and yet as the Sunne is viſible to the eye, and the ſoule ſubiect to the ſight of reaſon,
<note place="margin">God of man in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſeene and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.</note> ſo God in a meaſure, is truly ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſibly to be ſeene, and iudicially to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, of all thoſe which haue eyes to behold, and reaſon to conſider ſuch creatures, as he hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be witneſſes of his nature. But the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in the body,
<note place="margin">The body the graue of the ſoule.</note> as in a graue, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the graue of the ſoule, and the Sun ſhining in heauen openly to be ſeene, the eyes of men haue beene drawne to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and there to ſeeke God, where manifeſtly appearing, they could not but ſee him in all glory and maieſtie to ſhine. Howbeit, in ſearching to know what he was, their errors were as groſſe, as their opinions were diuers; Some thinking the Sunne, others the Moone, and other-ſome the whole circuit of heauen,
<note place="margin">By naturall reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to know what God is.</note> to be a God. And no meruaile that they were deceaued, when by the low reach of naturall reaſon, they ſought to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the high miſtery of that ſupernaturall power, which is infinite and incomprehenſible: But that it was onely one, otherwiſe they could not thinke,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13177:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>reaſon manifeſtly teaching, that otherwiſe it could not be. For when by conſideration of all naturall things it is euident, that nothing is of power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make or to mooue it ſelfe, and that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of contraries, they are more apt to deſtroy, then able to cauſe or preſerue one another, moſt reaſonably it is that there be, becauſe of neceſsitie it is that there muſt be, a maker, a moouer, and a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of them all, and how? A maker, of omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to doo what he will, a moouer, of aucthoritie to diſpoſe as he will, and a ruler of all goodnes and excellencie, to order and preſerue all according to his will; elſe were it impoſsible that the world ſhould haue been made, mooued, and ordered as it hath been, conſiſting of parts no leſſe repugnant in nature, then infinite in number.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in regard of his excelling good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in gouerning and preſeruing both the whole, and euery particuler whatſoeuer. VVho ſo being as in very truth he is, the originall cauſe from which all things doo proceede, the roote of life out of which all life doth ſpring, and the fountaine of goodnes, from whence all good doth ariſe &amp; flow, then is he but one, for it cannot be that more then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13177:36"/>one, that cauſe, that roote, and that fountaine can be.
<note place="margin">The cauſe of cauſes can be but one.</note> That cauſe of cauſes, that is, the cauſer of all things, was to haue being, before any thing had beginning, and be he muſt onely by, and of him ſelfe, for be he could not by participation of any thing elſe, when all whatſoeuer is, or euer was, by him was made, and from him did proceede. So was he the firſt, yet not by priority of time, by worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of nature, or by order of beginning, for he was before time, aboue nature, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but firſt, becauſe all were after him, and none equall and together with him: And as the firſt, ſo the laſt, for hauing no beginning, he can haue no ending, being vnborne he cannot dye, if nothing had power to make him, what can be able to deſtroy him? Then being the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end, he is that he is, and ſhall be that he ſhall be, when all things that are ſhall not be, not as now they are, but changed in nature, as he can neuer be, that is aboue nature, and therfore one alone, and the ſame. And being the firſt and the maker of all, he was almighty, and had all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in him ſelfe. But ſo he could not be, if any other were of like power, and could doo as much as him ſelfe. For what is giuen to the one, is taken from the other, ſo as what the one hath, the other wanteth, and to haue any want at all, were againſt the nature of eyther, there being no fulnes where there is want, nor perfection where defect is found. If then a maker and almighty, as he muſt be that is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13177:36"/>God; there can be no partner of his power, there ought to be no pertaker of his glory. Neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is it that life ſhould be giuen by more then one: whereof the roote muſt be one or none, for when all things that can be liuing of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities muſt conſiſt, and life is nothing elſe but an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body and ſoule, which can neuer be vnited but when thoſe contraries of diſpoſition to one iuſt, and peaceable conſtitution are reduced, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by nouriture groweth, and ſtrength doth enſue, it followeth that whatſoeuer giueth life, muſt be of all vnitie, without any the leaſt diuerſitie within it ſelfe; otherwiſe, if any difference it ſhould haue, and not altogether be one, wherein it wanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, more to the one, then to the other it would incline. So ſhould there be no equality of mixture for partiality of fauour, and ſo no peace, no vnity, no life ſhould be, wherefore one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one in number, one in all, that one which is the authour of life ought to be. If it be ſayed that Gods may be the ſame in nature, and yet ſundry in number, and that in them giuing life, no ſuch vnity is required, but that which may fall into more then one, no affinity being betweene the life giuers, and the liuing things, betweene the nature of Gods, and the naturall parts of the world, it muſt be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that in trueth to God neyther nature nor number can be aſcribed, he being an eſſence in no ſort to be conceaued; if not ſupernaturally and al in ſinglenes he be conſidered. For although he be not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13177:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeene of men,
<note place="margin">God ſeene of men in the glaſſe of nature.</note> but in the glaſſe of nature, yet therin his greatnes doth appeare ſo much to exceede her compaſſe, as eaſily they perceaue, and aſſuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue that he is ſo much aboue, and ſo farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her reach, as that he cannot be ſubiect to the force of her lawes. VVherfore, when mortall men according to theyr naturall vnderſtanding ſearch for him, they finde what he is not, and there-vpon conclude him to be that which moſt probably theyr weaknes can neuer be comprehended. VVhereof it hath been, that ſundry wiſe &amp; learned men haue thought no better way to define what he was, then by way of deniall, to ſhew what he was, not ſaying that neyther the heauen, nor the skie, nor the ſun, nor the moone, nor the elements, nor the world was God, but the works of God, and therfore God to be the maker of all. So reaſon teaching that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity muſt needes be after vnity, and that one there muſt be, before many ones there can be, the ſame concludeth, that God which is the firſt, cannot be <hi>multiplex ſed vnus,</hi> not many but one. Againe, ſith nothing can be compounded which may not be diſſolued, it followeth, that God which is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting without diſſolution, could not be but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall without compoſition, and therefore <hi>ens vnum et ſimplicimum.</hi> And ſo being moſt reaſonable it is to thinke, that he that is onely, and merely one, one in all vnity and ſimplicity, is fitteſt to ſet at one thoſe things which are of contrary diſpoſition, he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13177:37"/>being not likely to leane to eyther ſide, who hath nothing in him bending to eyther part, whereas being many and diuers (as diuers they muſt be, if they be manie) they could not poſsiblie make a peace, where contrariety mooueth a warre. For how ſhould things ſubiect vnto them, by them be drawne together, who through diuerſity of them ſelues are not one, but ſtand aſunder? How ſhould fire end water, become friends, if as <hi>Thales</hi> thought,
<note place="margin">Dioge. laerti.</note> there were one God to doo all out of water, and one other, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> might as wel haue thought, to doo as much out of fire. There could not, nor there needed not an attonement to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, if both Gods had power a like by eyther, without the helpe of other to doo what he would. But they muſt be vnited and coupled as man and wife, before any lyuing thing can be brought forth.</p>

Goodnes in him, and he in goodnes ought to excell, and that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, becauſe all good into all parts of the world is deriued from him, and he alone in good eſtate doth preſerue, gouerne, and order all. The Sunne
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13177:38"/>ſhineth, the earth flouriſheth, trees grow, beaſts mooue, and man through him and by him, doth enioy whatſoeuer is good in euery of them.

But if it be thought that for the rule of the world there needeth not a chiefe King, and that there may be fellow Gods in heauen, as men haue peeres on earth, and that one God is not ſufficient to be the authour and worker of all good; let it be ſought if it be reaſonable, and by reaſon it ſhall be found to be impoſsible,
<note place="margin">Impoſsible the world ſhould be ruled by more Gods then one.</note> that the whole world ſhould be ruled, as it is, and ſo long as it hath beene, all things being ordered with ſuch wiſedome, and held in one ſetled courſe without deſtruction, if there were more rulers of the world then one, who being of equall power, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13177:39"/>rule, could not but ſtriue to excell, which of all things to the nature of God is moſt agreeable. Then ſhould there be warre in heauen without end, for who ſhould giue place, the warriers being equall that doo contend? And in the world no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but contention and trouble; the fire with the water, the ayre with the earth, the ſtarres with the planets, all powers both high and low, both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and earthly would fight; for how ſhould the Subiects be at peace, their Soueraignes being at variance? VVhich ſo being, what could enſue but confuſion and deſtruction? VVherefore, the quiet peace of earthly creatures, the wonderfull harmony of heauenly bodies, the iuſt returne, and neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling courſe of euery time and ſeaſon, doth ſhew and prooue, that to one power and one will, that is to one God, whoſe power is his will, they are ſubiect all. Day to day, and night to night; the Moone to the night, as the Sunne to the day, the one to the yeare, as the other to the moneth, is a witnes that more rulers then one they know not, that more Gods then one they haue not. If it be ſayed notwithſtanding, that which hath beene ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by the iudgement of auntient Poets, men of learning and wiſedome, it may be thought there are more Gods then one. For that by them ſeuerall kingdomes to ſundry Gods were allotted, as if one were not ſufficient to gouerne all.
<note place="margin">Why many Gods by the Poets fayned.</note> It may be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that thereby their meaning was to beate downe the pride of earthly Kings, who could not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13177:39"/>be contented with their owne, but thought them ſelues fit, and ambitiouſly ſought to rule the whole world. And that therein alſo did appeare that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Gods, doth ouerthrow the dignity of a God, that from many, many miſchiefes would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and that to rule in order, keepe in peace, and in happines to preſerue the world, there needed but one, and more then one there could not be. For their aucthority being deuided, and ſeuered ſondry wayes, they were euer at ſtrife and contention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about the ſauing or deſtroying of men, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Citties, and common wealths.</p>

For how ſhould it otherwiſe be, he being able by ſaying the word, to perfect the whole worke of heauen and earth, out of duſt to create the body of man, and with his breath to make him a lyuing ſoule; what power can be greater, or what is able to expreſſe the greatnes thereof? If heauen and earth had a voyce, if the birds of the ayre, and the beaſts of the field could ſpeake, they would open their mouthes, and ſtraine them ſelues, to ſound out the wonderfull might of their almighty God.

Yet as in the firſt beginning, ſuch was the pride of the firſt mans hart, that where eyes were giuen vnto him to caſt them vpward to behold heauen, and therein to glorifie as well the maker of him ſelfe, as the Creator ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he looked downe vpon him ſelfe, and lifted vp his mind into heauen, deſiring rather to be as God, then to honour God as he ſhould haue done, ſo euer ſithence the ofspring of his ſeede, being line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infected with the corruption of his attaynted blood, hath offended in the proud conceite of it ſelfe, and in forgetfulnes of the Lord God; euery braunch drawing venom from that poyſoned root, though all bring not forth like bitter fruite.

And that God of his goodnes graunted vnto him, being but a lump of earth, rule and aucthority ouer all the earth, whereby he was as great as he could wiſh, and more happy then he did conceaue him ſelfe to be, all things being ready to ſerue him, and nothing able or apt to reſiſt him. But when rebelling againſt that good God his maker, he ſhewed him ſelfe an vnthankfull creature, and was not pleaſed to be a chiefe Soueraigne in bearing rule like vnto God ouer all the world, but would be a very God on earth, as God him ſelfe was in heauen, hauing all knowledge of good and euill, what followed?

VVhat ſucceſſe it had, we ſaw, they felt, the world knoweth: and time will neuer forget, but all places, and all ages, the fartheſt and the laſt, ſhall remember, to the glorie of God, whoſe work it was, to the renowne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Lieuetenant ſhe was, and to the honour of Engliſhmen, whoſe ſouldiers they were,

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13177:56"/>his owne ouerthrow gaue honour to the Nation, he meant to deſtroy the people, but killed ſcarce a man.

So the Lord God, high and mightie, ſtretched foorth his arme, to make his ſtrength knowne, that all the world might learne to feare &amp; honour his holy name; eſpecially that hee, vvhich was proude in his owne forces, and lifted vp in his owne eyes, might ſee and vnderſtand, that God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured not th'ambition of his hart, and the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his deſire: and that his ſtrength was weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and his greatnes nothing, God bending his countenaunce, &amp; putting out his hand againſt him. And that wee, which were defended &amp; kept ſafe, with the ſhield of his mercy, might euermore with thankfulnes acknowledge his goodnes, and vvith continuall prayſes, ſette forth his euerlaſting glory, to the vttermoſt parts of the world, (if it may bee) and to the worlds end. But if he proceed as <hi>Pharao</hi> did in the hardneſſe of his hart, it is to be thought, that the purpoſe of the Lord is, to get more honor of him. And if wee forget, as Iſraell often did, to walke after his Law, and to ſerue him aright, it is to be feared, leaſt before we come to the Land of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13177:57"/>Canaan, we ſhall feele the bitterneſſe of famine, &amp; the ſharpnes of the ſworde, and the deſtruction of many thouſands amongſt vs. The Lorde GOD which hath done ſo much for vs, make vs mindful of him, and carefull of our ſelues, which wee ſhall be, if truly we think of him, and of our ſelues; that is, if in his fauour, and not in our owne power wee repoſe our ſafetie; if wee ſette our ſtrength in his arme, and looke for defence from his right hand, reſoluing that all fleſh is corrupt, feeble, and fraile, and that euen the pureſt, the ſoundeſt, &amp; the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt, conſiſting thereof, as a flower in the fielde is eaſily pulled vp, and as the greateſt Oake, is cutte downe in an hower: the one aſſuredly to wither, the other neuer to growe againe. So, when the mightieſt Prince of the earth, affying in himſelfe, maketh warre againſt vs, and threatneth with fire and ſword to deuoure vs, wee may with comfort thinke, and ſay with aſſurance to our ſelues, as dyd the Athenians, when <hi>Xerxes</hi> with his huge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable armie,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VIth God is power infinite, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome incomprehenſible, as hee is a God, he cannot be but omnipotent, but altogether and exceeding wiſe; wiſe aboue the reach, omnipotent beyond the iudgement of any mortal creature. Yet in nothing is he to himſelfe ſo like, and to man ſo well known, as in that he is good, and therein, both his power and his wiſedome are excelled, although from him, neither the one nor the other can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. By his power, hee made the world of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and by his wiſedome he made it to be of all perfection,
<note place="margin">The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, the cauſe of creation &amp; preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world.</note> and the ſame thorough both hee dooth daily rule, order, and preſerue; but it was his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which firſt cauſed him to make it, and it is that, which maketh him ſtill to be carefull of it, to the end all ſhould be pertaker of that, which of nothing but of it ſelfe can participate. Other cauſe there could be none, becauſe beeing of all fulneſſe, he could feele no want, nor any thing could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him. Not excellencie, wherein hee euer was aboue all that haue beene, or could be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. Nor glory, which filling heauen, ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted farre the meaſure of worldly honor; his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13177:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>onely was inlarged when it was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo much the more, by how much the leſſe it was deſerued. VVhen he had framed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vaute of heauen, and eſtabliſhed the ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth,
<note place="margin">Gene, 2.</note> and finiſhed all the hoſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, he ſaw all that was made, and all was good; for nothing other then good from him could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede: but to man much more, though not more worthie,
<note place="margin">Man the end of gods creation.</note> that goodnes did abound. Hee was the laſt of his creatures, as the end of his creation, all made for him, and all repreſented in him; the reſt, by his word commaunding, whereas his bodie by his hand working, &amp; his ſoule by his breath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<note place="margin">Man the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God.</note> became aliue: whereby hee was the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Maker, pure, full of knowledge, and a Lord ouer all. And albeit hee fell wilfully to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, being vnthankfully diſobedient, and vvas depriued of his lordly eſtate, beeing thorough his owne default both in body and ſoule defiled, yet would GOD, becauſe hee would be Goo, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly aboue meaſure, ſo euerlaſtingly without end, vouchſafe to reſtore him againe, in clenſing his thoughts, inſtructing his hart, &amp; holding all things in ſubiection vnto him.
<note place="margin">What the ſtate and condition of man, were, being fallen, and not reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by god.</note> VVhich if he had not don, and did not ſtill continue to doe, man ſhould not differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a brute beaſt in vnderſtanding, his whole life ſhould be filthy and corrupt, and not a day, nor an howre, hee ſhould liue in ſafetie. His reaſon ſhould be as the ſubtiltie of the Foxe, his deſire as the luſt of the Horſe, his life ſoiled in vice, as the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13177:59"/>ſwine wallowing in mire, and ſoone ended ſhould it be, by the aſſault of deuouring beaſts, or furie of peſtilent diſeaſes. Thys were the condition of man, were it not for the goodnes of God.
<note place="margin">God is euer working for the good of man, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> But for the good of man, or rather for his owne goodneſſe ſake, he is euer working both generally, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of all man-kinde, and particularly, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of euery one, but eſpecially, for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe which are his, and repoſe their truſt in him. Sundry waies hee offereth inſtruction to their harts, and giueth correction for their faults, he ſtriketh a naturall feare in the creatures, wherby they become, and remaine ſubiect vnto them, and diſcouereth the vertue of whatſoeuer hath or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth life, for their neceſſarie vſe, for the ſtrength &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of their daies. Let ſome inſtans be produced. The Sea he holdeth within bankes to the good of all, leaſt they ſhould bee ouer-whelmed, &amp; drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the earth. The Turke he boundeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lymits, to preſerue the Chriſtians, that they may not bee ouer-runned &amp; deuoured of infidels. The Sunne he cauſeth to ſhine vpon all the worlde, for the health and comfort of all Nations; and vvith his Goſpell he lighteneth ſome ſpeciall places, for the ſpirituall comfort and ſoules health of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. So is he good to all,
<note place="margin">The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding &amp; beſtowing</note> but in greater meaſure to ſome, and good he is aſwell in beſtowing benefits, as in with-holding miſchiefes; but chiefely good, in that out of his owne meere goodnes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the leaſt their worthines, he dooth whatſoeuer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13177:60"/>he doth for them. For all being guiltie of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, and all vnder the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alike, no grace is of dutie, nothing but puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due. This the world cannot but ſee, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one as hee receiueth moſt, ought moſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame. Not a man liuing vpon the face of the earth, but in that he liueth and is a man, in that all the creatures are vnder his rule, in that he knoweth how to rule them, &amp; to make them ſerue his vſe, which for his vſe are appointed, is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound vnto God,
<note place="margin">Euery man bound infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to God for his goodnes.</note> and to confeſſe howe good a God hee is therein. For whatſoeuer man hee bee, without hurt to God, or wrong to him, hee might haue beene a ſtone, without life, or with life a brute beaſt without reaſon. So to haue made him, was in the power of the Maker, &amp; no cauſe in himſelfe, why of better condition he ſhould be. VVherfore in this the goodneſſe of God is generally vpon all, euen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſt barbarous people of the world, that they liue, and that in life they enioy many ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and commodities, through the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue, and good they receiue of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, knowing howe to ouercome the ſtrongeſt, to tame the wildeſt,
<note place="margin">The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God ſpecially is to thoſe, which haue knowledge of him, and his ſeruice,</note> and to employ them all to ſome good vſe or other. But incomparably more is the bleſsing of God extended vnto thoſe, which ouer and aboue the common benefits of naturall life, and humaine reaſon, haue the true knowledge of God, and of his Sonne reuealed vnto them, vvhereby they liue a ſpirituall life, and are in the way to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

So as ineſtimable is that goodnes, whereby ſuch happineſſe is obtained; and right happy are they, which by that eſpeciall teſtimony may be aſſured, that eſpecially they are beloued of the Almightie, who is the true author and free giuer of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whatſoeuer.
